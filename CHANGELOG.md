# Changelog

All notable changes to Vatrushka are documented here. The project follows semantic versioning for desktop and API release artifacts.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- cohesive desktop design system, Storybook catalog and responsive server shell;
- replies, reactions, attachments, unread state, native notifications, direct messages and virtualized message feeds;
- visible microphone/output selection, per-participant volume and local mute controls;
- monitor/window source picker, presenter audio mode and independent viewer stream-audio mixer;
- server role hierarchy, channel overrides, permission-enforced LiveKit grants and audit log;
- password/email/TOTP/recovery authentication, trusted sessions, revocation and security events;
- release gates for Storybook accessibility, Electron E2E, Windows visual regression, migrations and renderer bundle budgets.

### Changed

- desktop, API and shared packages now report version 0.3.0;
- the migration runner resolves its Drizzle folder correctly on both Windows and Linux;
- Windows packaging waits for the complete desktop regression suite in CI.

### Operations

- migrations remain additive and must not be renumbered or squashed after deployment;
- this release still requires a manually configured production API, SMTP and LiveKit deployment;
- installers are not code-signed and automatic updates are not enabled yet.
